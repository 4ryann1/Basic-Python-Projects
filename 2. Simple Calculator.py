# Simple Calculator ðŸ§®
# Create a basic command-line calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
# â€¢	Description: The program asks the user for two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /).
#       It then performs the calculation and prints the result.
# â€¢	Concepts Covered: Functions, if/elif/else statements, user input, and basic arithmetic operators.
# â€¢	Next Step: Improve it by adding more operations like exponents (**) or modulus (%).
#       You can also wrap the main logic in a
#       loop so the user can perform multiple calculations without restarting the script.

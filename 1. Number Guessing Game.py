# Here are some basic Python projects perfect for beginners to practice fundamental programming concepts.
# Number Guessing Game ðŸ”¢
# A fun game where the computer thinks of a random number, and the user has to guess it.
# Description: The program generates a secret random number within a range (e.g., 1 to 100).
# The user enters guesses, and the program tells them if their guess is too high, too low, or correct.
# You can also add a limit on the number of guesses.
# Concepts Covered: random module, input() and print() functions, while loops, if/elif/else statements,
# and converting strings to integers.
# Next Step: Add difficulty levels that change the range of numbers (e.g., 1-50 for easy, 1-100 for hard).
